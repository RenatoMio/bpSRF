 Github site for the bpSRF, a body-powered supernumerary robotic finger
## Project Overview
This project provides a 3D printable prosthetic finger that can be easily assembled using standard tools and materials. The design is modular, allowing for customization and adjustments based on individual needs.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: The finger is composed of several parts that can be printed and assembled independently.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the STL files to fit different sizes and requirements.
- **Low-Cost Materials**: Designed to be assembled using affordable, readily available materials.

## Getting Started
